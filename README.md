# WK18C-Social-Network-API

## Description
  This repo contains code for a "Social Network API". On my own, I was tasked with 
  designing an api that utilizes MongoDB to create a social network that uses a NoSQL
  database to handle large ammounts of unstructured data
  
  With mongoDB and express, i was able to create a fully functional api that fit the
  criteria. A link to a walkthrough video can be found [here](#usage)
